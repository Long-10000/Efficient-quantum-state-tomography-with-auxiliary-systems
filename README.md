# Efficient-quantum-state-tomography-with-auxiliary-systems
source code for Efficient quantum state tomography with auxiliary systems.

The program includes `Density Matrix Reconstruction Algorithm.py` and `func_lib.py`. `Data.py` is only used to store 4 sets of simulated data as examples.

### Usage of Data.py :
